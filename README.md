# Portfolio_Site
This is a final term project for MET's CS601 Front End Web Development course. Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue- the portfolio site aims to show my skills in these topics and previously completed projects.

**email.js 
** 
This script takes the values from the site form, opens a new email on the user's computer, and pre-fills the body of the email with the values from the form.

**iss.js
**
This script pulls the current coordinates of the ISS from the "whereistheiss" API, then uses "bigdatacloud" API to reverse-GeoCode the coordinates and give the approximate location of the ISS in terms of country/ocean location.

**navbar.js**
This uses an event listener to see if the user has begun scrolling down the page, once they scroll past the location "25," the navbar transitions and scrolls up to disappear. 

**screen_reload.js**
The screen reload script refreshes the screen from the very top of the screen whenever a user refreshes the screen.

**stock_watcher.js**
This script pulls API data from the "house stock watcher" API, sorts transactions by disclosure date, and pastes to the "stock" element the latest stock transaction made by a U.S. Congressperson. 

**vue.js**
This is used on the "design" page to change an image when the user's mouse hovers over it.
